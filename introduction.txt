## Brief Introduction About Myself

Emmanuel Dodoo is a seasoned professional serving as the Front Desk Supervisor at Mole Motel Company Limited and an emerging software engineering and data analytics expert. With over six years of experience in project management, process optimization, and leadership, I have developed custom Excel VBA systems that boosted check-in efficiency by 20% and improved inventory tracking accuracy by 30%. 

Passionate about software development, data analysis, and AI fundamentals, Emmanuel leverages self-taught expertise in Visual Basic, ongoing Python training, and technical credentials from the ALX AiCE program to deliver scalable, data-driven solutions. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Sociology from the University of Ghana, where I demonstrated strong leadership as President of the Association of Philosophy and Classics Students. Dedicated to driving digital transformation and streamlining operations, Emmanuel aspires to transition into a full-time software engineering role, ready to make a significant impact on the future of technology. I am currently learning Git and GitHub to enhance my technical skills and better manage collaborative projects. This project marks my first hands-on experience using GitHub for version control.
